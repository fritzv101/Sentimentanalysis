# Sentiment analysis with Natural Language Processing

Language learners struggle to acquire both linguistic nuances and vernacular expressions in our increasingly
interconnected society. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used in this project, "Culturally
Fluent: Sentiment Analysis for Language Learners," to detect sentiments contained in casual texts. We enable
learners to confidently navigate cross-cultural communication by offering subtle insights into common interactions,
which promotes deeper cultural integration.

GOAL
Develop a model that recognizes and interprets sentiments within informal language contexts.
Our objectives encompass cultural integration by enhancing understanding of nuances, aiding language learning
through sentiment insights in informal communication, and achieving success in accurately identifying sentiments for
various tones, supported by successful descriptive and comparative analyses, including accuracy rates in informal
versus formal texts.

DATASETS
Datasets:
1. SMS Spam Collection: SMS messages labeled as ham or spam, reflecting informal language.
2. Text Emotion Recognition: Diverse sentiment-laden language for understanding nuanced expressions.
3. Chat/Internet Slang: Evolving language in online communication, replacing abbreviations.
4. Social Media Slang: Contemporary social media language, replacing internet abbreviations.
5. Sentiment140: 1.6 million annotated tweets for general sentiment analysis.
   
By combining different datasets, bias is reduced and exposure to a wide range of informal language is ensured,
which promotes cultural sensitivity and adaptation. The model is further personalized by building a customized
dataset from language learners' expressions, which is in line with moral AI principles and meets particular language
learning requirements.
